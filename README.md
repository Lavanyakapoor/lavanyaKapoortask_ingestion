Ingestion API by Lavanya Kapoor
it is an API made using flask that accepts a list of IDs and a priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW), splitting IDs into batches of up to 3.

It provides status updates for tasks and their batches (yet_to_start, triggered, completed).

The priority of the tasks is handled with the order of high>medium>low.

Design Choices :
Flask is used here because it aloows for easy development and fast deployment.
Tasks are stored in a deque and sorted by priority and timestamp for fair scheduling.
Task status is derived from batch statuses:
yet_to_start: All batches are yet_to_start.
triggered: At least one batch is triggered.
completed: All batches are completed.
